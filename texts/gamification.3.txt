Abstract
This paper reviews peer-reviewed empirical studies
on gamification. We create a framework for examining
the effects of gamification by drawing from the
definitions of gamification and the discussion on
motivational affordances. The literature review covers
results, independent variables (examined motivational
affordances), dependent variables (examined
psychological/behavioral outcomes from gamification),
the contexts of gamification, and types of studies
performed on the gamified systems. The paper
examines the state of current research on the topic and
points out gaps in existing literature. The review
indicates that gamification provides positive effects,
however, the effects are greatly dependent on the
context in which the gamification is being
implemented, as well as on the users using it. The
findings of the review provide insight for further
studies as well as for the design of gamified systems.
1. Introduction
During the last couple of years, gamification
[9][28][31] has been a trending topic and a subject to
much hype as a means of supporting user engagement
and enhancing positive patterns in service use, such as
increasing user activity, social interaction, or quality
and productivity of actions [25]. These desired use
patterns are considered to emerge as a result of
positive, intrinsically motivating [35], “gameful”
experiences [31] brought about by game/motivational
affordances implemented into a service.
As a result, gamification is touted as a next
generation method for marketing and customer
engagement in popular discussion (e.g. [45]). For
instance, Gartner [19] estimates that over 50% of
organizations managing innovation processes will
gamify aspects of their business by 2015. Furthermore,
there is an increasing number of successful startups
whose entire service is focused on adding a gamified
layer to a core activity (e.g. Codecademy, a service that
uses game-like elements to help teach users how to
code), or who assist more traditional companies in
gamifying their existing services (e.g. Badgeville).
The popular interest in gamification is also
reflected in an academic context: the number of papers
published on gamification is growing. Figure 1 gives
an overview of the increase of writings on the topic. It
is especially noteworthy that the appearance of the
term “gamification” in paper titles has been increasing
even more rapidly than general search hits. This
suggests that gamification is becoming a more popular
subject for academic inquiry.
Despite the large amount of hits on the topic, there
is a dearth of coherent understanding on what kind of
studies have been conducted under the term
gamification, with which methods, what kinds of
results they yield, and under which circumstances.
Understanding whether gamification is effective is
also a pertinent practical issue. A remarkably large
number of firms now provide gamification services,
and investments are being made into gamificationrelated
efforts. As any other hot marketing topic,
gamification is discussed in length, for example, in the
2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Science

industry chatter, largely based on anecdotal and
intuitive presumptions ranging from extremely
negative to extremely positive perceptions. Thus,
empirical results on the effectiveness of gamification
are in demand.
This paper contributes to the understanding of
gamification by reviewing the existing body of
empirical research on the topic.
2. Conceptualizing gamification
Gamification has been defined as a process of
enhancing services with (motivational) affordances in
order to invoke gameful experiences and further
behavioral outcomes [31][25]. In defining
gamification, Huotari and Hamari [31] highlight the
role of gamification in invoking the same
psychological experiences as games (generally) do.
Deterding et al. [9], on the other hand, emphasize that
the affordances implemented in gamification have to
be the same as the ones used in games, regardless of
the outcomes (Figure 2). However, it is unclear which
affordances are unique to games as well as which
psychological outcomes can be strictly considered to
stem from games. From the perspective of these
definitions, there is room for a large variety of studies
that could be framed as gamification. Therefore, one
goal of this review is to explore what the actual
empirical works on gamification have been studying as
motivational affordances and psychological outcomes
(as well as behavioral outcomes).
Nevertheless, conceptualizing gamification [31] in
the manner presented here allows us to connect the
concept to the literature on motivational affordances in
IS research (see [44]), and further, break down the
studies reviewed herein (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Gamification
According to this conceptualization, gamification
can be seen to have three main parts: 1) the
implemented motivational affordances, 2) the resulting
psychological outcomes, and 3) the further behavioral
outcomes. Therefore, in this review we focus on
examining 1) what motivational affordances the
reviewed studies have implemented as dependent
variables, 2) what psychological outcomes have been
measured as possibly both independent and dependent
variables, as well as 3) what behavioral outcomes have
been measured as dependent variables. Furthermore,
we will investigate what services have been gamified,
and which methodologies have been used to study the
effects.
3. Literature review
3.1. Step 1: General database search
Searches were made in the following databases:
Scopus, ScienceDirect, EBSCOHost, Web of Science,
ACM Digital library, AISel, Google Scholar, and
Proquest. The search terms gamification, gamif*,
gameful and “motivational affordance” were used on
all databases. The search terms were used for all fields
(including title, abstract, keywords and full text), and
all result types were included (Table 1). The middle
column in Table 1 contains all results, including nonscientific
writings such as magazine articles, trade
publications etc. Thus, the figures in the column
merely indicate the popularity of the subject.

* The true number of peer-reviewed papers in some
of the databases is lower than reported, as the
results contain in some cases, for example, nonpeer-reviewed
short articles published in academic
journals.
3.2. Step 2: Focused searches
After the initial database searches to determine
which databases provide results, focused searches in
the databases were conducted. Focused searches were
performed with the following preliminary criterion:
1) peer-reviewed full paper published in an
international venue
After narrowing down the results to peer-reviewed
studies, the following criteria were implemented and
the search further refined by going through the results:
2) empirical study included
3) research methods are explicated
4) paper studies clearly identifiable motivational
affordances
3026
5) the study was on gamification rather than on
full games
The literature search proceeded with a screening of
the different databases in the following order (the
number in brackets indicates how many non-identical,
new papers were found from each library): 1) ACM
Library (13), 2) Scopus (5), 3) ScienceDirect (2), 4)
AISel (2), and 5) Google Scholar (1). The rest of the
databases provided previously found results. Most
papers were published in various computer
science/HCI conference proceedings. A few studies
were specifically on gamifying learning and were
published in venues such as Computer in Human
Behavior and Computers and Education. Also, a few
papers had been published in management information
systems venues, such as Electronic Commerce
Research and Applications, European Conference on
Information Systems, and Management Science.
3.3. Step 3: Additional searches through
references
We further investigated the references of the
initially found papers and the references made to those
papers. With this method, 1 paper not covered in the
databases, yet highly relevant for the literature review,
was discovered.
The papers in the literature search (Steps 3.2. and
3.3.) that did not satisfy the set criteria mostly divided
into the following four categories:
1) conceptual papers
2) engineering papers describing a system being
engineered (without evaluation)
3) gamification was mentioned in the text in
passing and the actual substance was not
gamification-related
4) short papers/research-in-progress/extended
abstracts
After performing the three steps of the literature
search, 24 peer-reviewed, empirical research papers on
gamification were identified for the review. The full
list of the chosen papers can be found in Appendix A.
3.4. Step 4: Analysis
In order to incorporate our discussion on the
definition of gamification into our results, we combine
the model of motivational affordances in ICT [44] with
a modified version of the concept matrix presented by
Webster and Watson [40] as a way of systematically
collecting and analyzing the different motivational
affordances and resulting outcomes.
The papers were analyzed and categorized based on
the provided framework on gamification. The results of
the analysis were gathered into a table (Appendix A).
4. Results
Altogether 24 empirical studies were examined in
the literature review. Though not always explicitly
stated, the high-level research question shared between
the papers was: Does gamification work? The
gamification implementations varied between the
studies in terms of what game-like motivational
affordances had been implemented (section 4.1.).
Moreover, the measurement of effectiveness also
varied from motivation and engagement-related
psychological outcomes to use behavior-related
outcomes (section 4.2.), and the studies yielded both
positive and negative results (section 4.3.) in a wide
variety of contexts (section 4.4.). The results were
achieved using both quantitative and qualitative
methods (section 4.5.). For a complete list on the
details of reviewed studies, see Appendix A, where
studies are further grouped based on the motivational
affordance [44] categories.
4.1. Motivational affordances
In accordance with Webster and Watson [40], we
collected and combined the different motivational
affordances found in the studies into 10 different
motivational affordance categories, based on the
terminology used in the reviewed papers.
Table 2 indicates the relatively large variety of
different elements tested in the empirical studies,
although points, leaderboards, and badges [26] were
clearly the most commonly found variants.

4.2. Psychological and behavioral outcomes
Table 3 shows that most of the studies examined
behavioral outcomes. These studies mainly used
experiments or statistical analyses from existing
services or implementations designed by the
researchers. Furthermore, use intentions were
investigated through survey methods.
Studies investigating psychological outcomes
mostly focused on aspects such as motivation, attitude
and enjoyment. These studies used either evaluative
interviews or questionnaires. Currently, only one study
[27] has used validated psychometric measurements.

4.3. Reported results
According to a majority of the reviewed studies,
gamification does produce positive effects and
benefits. Table 4 displays the reported findings of the
quantitative studies. Most of the reviewed papers
reported positive results for some of the motivational
affordances of the gamification implementations
studied. Only two studies found all of the tests positive.
Many of the quantitative papers were descriptive in
nature. Naturally, descriptive papers are not inferential
and, therefore, not able to infer about the effect of
gamification per se. Thus, even though the
implementations might have been received positively
by the users, no actual effects are reported.
Regarding the partially positive results, studies did
discuss why some of the expected results could not be
established. For instance, the largest studies in the
review ([25][32]) reported that gamification might not
be effective in a utilitarian service setting, but instead
engagement by gamification can depend on several
factors, such as the motivations of users (see [29]) or
the nature of the gamified system.
Complementary to the above findings, some studies
showed that the results of gamification may not be
long-term [25][15][16], but instead could be caused
due to a novelty effect. However, it also seems that
removing gamification might have detrimental effects
[37] to those users who are still engaged by
gamification, possibly due to loss aversion from losing
e.g. earned badges and points [24].
The findings of the fully qualitative studies as well
as the qualitative results of the mixed methods papers
consisted of both positive and negative perceptions
regarding the studied gamification implementations.
Positive experiences from gamification (e.g. on
engagement and enjoyment [34][11][33]) were
reported in all of the studies. At the same time,
however, the same aspects were most often disliked by
some respondents in the study.

4.4. Contexts of gamification
Context of gamification refers to the core service or
an activity being gamified. As shown in Table 5, the
range of contexts where the studies were performed
was wide. Gamification of education or learning was
the most common context for the implementations.
Most of the papers gamifying work were conducted in
crowdsourcing systems.
All of the studies in education/learning contexts
considered the learning outcomes of gamification as
mostly positive, for example, in terms of increased
motivation and engagement in the learning tasks as
well as enjoyment over them. However, at the same
time, the studies pointed to negative outcomes which
need to be paid attention to, such as the effects of
increased competition [22], task evaluation difficulties
[10], and design features [11][10].
Three out of four studies which studied intraorganizational
systems, investigated the gamification
of the same IBM’s Beehive system at different stages
[15][16][37]. The main results from these studies
indicate that gamification has a positive effect on some
users for a short time [16].
Surprisingly, none of the studies were explicitly
conducted in a marketing context (perhaps excluding
[25][12]), although gamification has been especially
touted as a potential marketing strategy. However, if
we look at the dependent variables across the studies,
they largely pertain to the increase in and quality of the
service/system use, which are considered as highly
important marketing metrics. Thus, the results of the
studies suggest implications for managerial and
business purposes regarding effects on engagement and
3028
use activity. However, no paper seemed to infer about
the relationship between gamification and purchase
behavior.

Table 6 reports the types of studies based on the
methodology used in the study. As indicated in Table
6, most of the studies were quantitative. Fully
qualitative studies were in the minority. The review
indicates that the research on gamification has
currently focused on using usage data and inferring
about user behavior directly.

5. Discussion
In this paper, the current efforts in empirical study
of gamification have been broken down into
components in order to structurally analyze the results
and state of the research. A conceptual framework for
gamification based upon the 1) motivational
affordances, 2) psychological outcomes, and 3) further
behavioral outcomes was provided and the studies
categorized on the basis of the framework.
Answering the question posed in title of the paper,
Does gamification work?, the literature review
suggests that, indeed, gamification does work, but
some caveats exist. The majority of the reviewed
studies did yield positive effects/results from
gamification. However, as can be seen from Table 4,
most of the quantitative studies concluded positive
effects to exist only in part of the considered
relationships between the gamification elements and
studied outcomes. Further, the studies that investigated
gamification qualitatively revealed that gamification as
a phenomenon is more manifold than the studies often
assumed. These observations suggest that some
underlying confounding factors exist. Most
prominently, the studies bring forth two main aspects:
1) the role of the context being gamified, and the 2)
qualities of the users. We discuss these issues in more
detail in the sub-section on further research avenues
(section 5.2.).
The literature review also revealed that more
rigorous methodologies ought to be used in further
research on gamification. Methodological limitations
and suggestions for avoiding the pitfalls of current
studies in future research are presented (section 5.1.).
The limitations of this review are also considered in
section 5.3.
5.1. Methodological limitations in the reviewed
studies
Several shortcomings could be identified during the
literature review: 1) the sample sizes were small in
some studies (around N=20), 2) proper, validated
psychometric measurements were not used (when
surveying experiences and attitudes), 3) some
experiments lacked control groups and relied solely on
user evaluation, 4) controls between implemented
motivational affordances were often lacking and
multiple affordances were investigated as a whole (i.e.
no effects from individual motivational affordances
could be established), 5) many presented only
descriptive statistics although they could have easily
also inferred about the relationship between constructs,
6) experiment timeframes were in most cases very
short (novelty might have skewed the test subjects'
experiences in a significant way), and 7) there was a
lack of clarity in reporting the results. 8) No single
study used multi-level measurement models including
all motivational affordances, psychological outcomes,
and behavioral outcomes. Further studies should
especially try to avoid these pitfalls in order to refine
the research on gamification.

5.2. Avenues for future research
The present studies on gamification and
motivational affordances suggest that the context of the
service might be an essential antecedent for engaging
gamification. In some of the reviewed studies, similar
considerations were expressed (e.g. [37][34][25]). For
example, Hamari [25] suggested that services oriented
towards strictly rational behavior, such as e-commerce
sites, might prove to be challenging systems to be
gamified as the users could be geared towards
optimizing economic exchanges.
Triangulating from self-determination theory [7] as
well as from the traditional definitions of games [3],
both suggest that outside pressures (such as extrinsic
rewards) undermine intrinsic motivations (see e.g. [6])
and hence would in essence undermine gamification
which is an attempt to afford for the emergence of
intrinsic motivations.
The understanding of the contextual factors would
benefit from considering the following theoretical
perspectives: (1) the social environment: theory of
planned behavior [1] states that the voluntariness of
carrying out a task is one of the main antecedents for
attitude formation and behavior; (2) the nature of the
system: is the system in question utilitarian or hedonic
in nature [5][39]; and (3) the involvement of the user:
is it cognitive or affective in nature [43].
The impact of the context of the gamified system
could be examined by experimental conditions. By
implementing certain motivational affordances and
holding them constant while varying the nature of the
underlying service could give insight into how the
context affects the outcomes of the gamification.
Furthermore, in many of the reviewed papers, user
qualities were believed to have an effect on attitudes
towards gamification [25][13][27][34], thus explaining
why in certain environment or only with certain users,
gamification had significant effects. As previous works
on player motivations suggest, people in fact interact
with game-like systems in different manners, and for
different reasons [29][42][38]. Thus, the experiences
created by the gamifying motivational affordances are
also likely to vary [31].
Eickhoff et al. [13] mention the emergence of
distinct "worker types" in their service, which gamified
crowdsourced relevance assessments. In addition, the
series of studies done on gamifying IBM's Beehive
social networking service [15][16][37] also note that
the users fell into distinct behavioral patterns: for
example, some users wanted to be at the very top of the
leaderboard, while for others it was enough to simply
appear on the leaderboard, regardless of ranking.
Hamari [25] suggests that sporadic nature of usage
might not be compatible with persistent gameful
affordances as the users might not spend enough time
within the service in order to become interested in
them.
Furthermore, the freeform feedback collected from
the participants in several of the studies contained
isolated comments where certain motivational
affordances (which otherwise received positive
comments) were felt as negative (such as ones
encouraging competition), lending credence to the idea
that different player types experience the same
affordances differently [31].
5.3. Limitations of this literature review
Gamification as an academic topic of study is
relatively young, and there are few well-established
theoretical frameworks or unified discourses. In this
literature review, only studies explicitly concerned
with gamification and motivational affordances were
included. Thus, the paper is limited with regards to
reporting research that has been done on other subjects
conceptually or theoretically close to gamification (e.g.
studies on intrinsic motivations) or similar with regards
to measured outcomes. Also, there are potentially
studies that investigate similar phenomena, but discuss
it with different terms, and thus, were difficult to find.
Here we relied on the selection criteria where the
empirical papers were clearly studying the effects of
implementation of game-like mechanics. Therefore, the
present paper provides a close look on the research
being done on the topic of gamification particularly.
Since the motivational affordances,
behavioral/psychological outcomes as well as the
methodologies varied greatly between the studies,
formal meta-analysis [30] could not be conducted.
Furthermore, many of the studies used qualitative
methods. As the research on gamification progresses,
care should be taken to ensure that future results are
more comparable. This can partly be ensured if future
studies will build upon the previously well executed
inferential studies with either proper experiments or
proper psychometric measurements and adequate
samples, such as [25][15][27][32][8].
