designer and scholar Ian Bogost, most
deployments of gamification represent
“exploitationware,” in that they extract
real value from users and employees in
return for mere virtual tokens.
As part of this charged debate, the
following pieces by practitioners and
researchers give insight into the current
state of thinking about the potentials
and limitations of gamification.
Gamification is not
a Dirty Word
By Judd Antin
Although gamification is far from
the panacea it is made out to be, as
a social psychologist and a designer
of incentive systems, I view it as a
positive trend.
Gamification signals a shift away
from the outdated view that pecuniary
(e.g., money, gifts) and instrumental
(e.g., information seeking)
motivations are the only ones worth
talking about. Not long ago, observThus,
gamification has ignited the
imagination of marketers, human
resources professionals, and others
interested in driving “engagement.”
Implementations are blooming across
a variety of sectors, including education
(Khan Academy), tutorials
(RibbonHero), health (HealthMonth),
task management (EpicWin), sustainability
(Recyclebank), crowdsourced science
(FoldIt), and user-generated content
for programmers (StackOverflow), to
name but a few.
At the same time, gamification has
drawn the ire of game designers, who
argue that the current stock implementation
of gamification—adding points,
badges, and leaderboards to mundane
user activities—is “taking the thing
that is least essential to games and
representing it as the core of the experience,”
as designer Margaret Robertson
put it. She contends that the pleasures
of games arise not from such system
feedback, but from “meaningful choices”
in the pursuance of “interestingly hard
goals.” Furthermore, in the words of
Games entice hundreds of millions of
people across the globe to spend countless
hours and dollars performing often
menial tasks—certainly, there must be
some way to use this power for other
purposes? Already in the 1980s, prescient
scholars like Thomas Malone followed
this intuition and began looking
into games as a source of “heuristics
for enjoyable interfaces.” In the early
2000s, the “serious games” movement
followed, building full-fledged
games to train, educate, and persuade.
In parallel, the field of human-computer
interaction began exploring the
various facets of user experience, and
design for pleasure, fun, and motivation
became topics of research.
Today the Web industry has put that
same intuition into the public limelight
again with a new buzzword: gamification.
Instead of creating full games,
gamification’s guiding idea is to use elements
of game design in non-game contexts,
products, and services to motivate
desired behaviors.
The sudden rise of gamification in the
past few years can be traced back to the
convergence of several enablers: cheap
sensors that allow the tracking of everyday
activity, a shift in Web analytics
to individuals and their behaviors, and
the current cultural momentum of video
games. Foursquare and Nike+, widely
publicized as case studies for successful
“gamified” mass market products, acted
as potent seed crystals.

ers were amazed by how much
Internet users would do “for free.”
Gamification, however, implicitly
acknowledges that while online
participants are usually unpaid,
they rarely work for free. Instead,
powerful social psychological processes
such as self-efficacy, group
identification, and social approval
provide rewards. These rewards
drive most of the long-term participation
we see in today’s social Web,
essentially through the power of
good feelings.
This is not a new idea.
Achievement badges, for example,
have a long and distinguished history.
The Boy Scouts of America
began handing out merit badges in
1911. They understood the motivational
power of goals, mastery
seeking, reputation, and identity
signaling with valued accomplishments.
Wikipedia’s Barnstars
(debuted in 2003) advertise and
reward valued Wiki-work and
effectively signal status because
Wikipedians award them to one
another within a meaningful
social context. Despite the hype,
the nuances and social meaning
that have made merit badges and
Barnstars effective are largely missing
from today’s gamification trend.
Most examples of gamification
do a remarkably poor job of understanding
where potential rewards
come from. None adequately
account for the ways in which individuals
and contexts differ. The
new dogma of gamification—actively
preached by a handful of pundits
and marketers—is in many ways as
bad as the old, in that social status
has replaced money as the universal
motivator. However, people
differ in the degree to which they
seek and advertise status. For some,
status signaling can be actively distasteful.
Furthermore, the propriety
of any given reward will differ by
context; what is appropriate in the
context of a sports-fan site, for
example, may not be in the context
of a health-discussion forum.
Ultimately, gamification has
a long way to go to achieve its
potential. But gamification is not
a dirty word. My hope is that serious
research and innovation will
help to produce systems that use
social psychological processes well
by taking into account contexts,
meanings, and individual differences.
Still, as a first step in creating
online systems that are more
engaging, supportive, and satisfying,
the popularity of gamification
signals an exciting trend.

Games as an Alternate
Lens for Design
By Elizabeth Lawley
Games can be powerful experiences,
leveraging both motivation
and engagement. The recent trend
toward “gamifying” applications,
however, often reduces the complexity
of a well-designed and
balanced game to its simplest
components, such as badges, levels,
points, and leaderboards. The
resulting implementations don’t
just fail to engage players; they can
actually damage existing interest
or engagement with the service or
product [1].
It’s not that gamification can’t
work. But to be successful, it must
include game design, not just game
components. Games are not a
replacement for thoughtful experience
and interaction design; they
are an alternate lens for framing
that process.
When we set out to create Just
Press Play, an achievement system
for students in interactive
games and media at the Rochester
Institute of Technology (play.rit.
edu), we began by thinking about
the behaviors we wanted to reward
and encourage, as well as the ways
in which a game could allow our
students to reflect on their accomplishments
and strengthen their
sense of competence and progress.
We know, for instance, that student
retention rates improve when
students are making meaningful,
positive connections with faculty
and/or staff [2]. To encourage those
connections, we created collectible
cards for our faculty and staff,
which students could receive in
exchange for a playful or creative
interaction. One faculty member
asks students to bring her pictures
of themselves eating pie; she is
covering one wall of her office with
these photos. Our digital audio
instructor asks players to bring him
a 10-second digital audio clip of a
sound “from their world.”
Other achievements are intended
to encourage collaborative rather
than individual work. Because
we’ve had difficulty in getting more
than 85 percent of our freshman to
pass the introductory programming
class, we created an achievement
called Undying. If 90 percent of our
freshmen passed the class, everyone
playing the game would receive
the achievement. In response,
juniors and seniors spontaneously
organized study sessions for the
freshmen before the final exam.
And while the students did unlock
the achievement (91 percent of the
freshmen passed the class), the real
win for us was that the upper-class
students enjoyed the tutoring so
much they asked permission to run
study sessions every quarter. The
achievement served as a catalyst,
but it was the activity itself, not
the achievement, that was the real
interactions
reward for the students.

Done right, gamification can help
enrich educational experiences in
a way that students will recognize
and respond to. Through our experience
with Just Press Play, we hope
to generate both a technical toolset
and a set of best practices for implementing
successful game-based
experiences in educational contexts.

Gamification Means
Amplifying Intrinsic Value
By Rajat Paharia
Over the past five years, we at
Bunchball have worked with more
than 100 companies to implement
gamification programs designed to
motivate and engage fans, customers,
and employees. The way we
approach each program is always
the same, and starts with a thorough
understanding of the business
goals. What are the user activities
that drive value, either directly or
indirectly, for the business? Next,
we develop a deep understanding
of users and what motivates
them to engage with the business.
This is a key point, and one
that often gets lost in the conversation
about gamification: The
entity being gamified needs to have
some intrinsic value already—a
reason for users to engage with
it. If you have a news site that
doesn’t have fresh news every
day, adding gamification will not
help, and you have bigger business
problems. But if your offering
has core intrinsic value that users
desire, then weaving gamification
into it can deepen their engagement
and desire to participate.
Whenever we engage with a new
system, we all, either explicitly or
implicitly, ask ourselves, “What’s
in it for me?” Understanding
why users engage with a business
helps to answer that question
and also points the way to
rewards the user base will find
meaningful and valuable.
With this understanding of the
primary stakeholders in mind, we
then work to create an experience
that engages users while accomplishing
the business objectives,
drawing from a palette of gamification
tools that include goal setting,
real-time feedback, transparency,
mastery, competition, teams, and
more. We craft a measurement plan
with the business so we can accurately
determine effectiveness and
ROI, and a communication plan that
details how the program should be
rolled out to users. Post-launch, we
work with them to analyze the data
coming out of their program and to
iterate and tweak it until it’s running
optimally.
Like anything else, gamification
can be done well and can be done
poorly. Companies that see the
success of Foursquare or Farmville
and just try to copy what they
see, without understanding the
stakeholders and their needs, are
destined to fail—as are those who
think they can replace meaningful
rewards and incentives with empty
points and badges, and manipulate
users into doing things they don’t
want to do.
Gamification is really a motivational
design problem, one that can
be best solved with design thinking
and design processes. Those companies
that figure out how to effectively
use gamification to amplify
the intrinsic motivations of their
employees, fans, and customers
will have a lasting competitive edge
in their markets.

product officer of Bunchball, the first vendor of a

If there is one unifying theme of
these pieces, it is to take gamification
seriously: to thoroughly consider
its potential, but more important,
to move beyond the indiscriminate
deployment of stock features toward
a deep understanding of the needs of
users, the value a system may provide
as a result of connecting with
them, and the complexity of interactions
that give rise to valued experiences—or
unintended consequences.
These have always been core tenets
of HCI. Hence, the field has much to
offer those interested in gamification:
a rich body of methods, a critical ethical
awareness, as well as insight into
the design and dynamics of collaborative,
reputation, and incentive systems.
Conversely, the current rise of gamification
promises abundant real-world data
on the uses and effects of such systems,
and a stimulating infusion of frameworks,
principles, and patterns from
game design that may inform HCI. At
its best, gamification means to identify
and facilitate the motivations behind
desired activities, using game design as
one guiding lens among many. The projects,
processes, and research collected
in this article present a first glimpse of
how this may look.
